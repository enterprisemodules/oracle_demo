# Customising your database

In this playground we will show you how easy it is to manage your database set-up with Puppet. How you can add and manage tablespaces, users and profiles. We will also show you one line of Puppet code that makes your database secure.

## The playground system

The playground system contains a pre-installed puppet agent.  There is no server available, so to run Puppet, you have to use the `puppet apply` command. The playground text will guide you with this.

On the playground system, you will find an Oracle database with the sid DB01. We have created it using the `ora_profile` module. The playground will guide you in your customisations.
